/**
 * This class does a lot and is quite dense and complicated. Here's the summary of what it does:
 *
 * Keeps track of what chunks every loaded multiblock has components in. This allows us
 * to quickly check whether placed/broken blocks have affected any multiblocks.
 *
 * Keeps track of which multiblocks are fully loaded (ie, all chunks that they have
 * components in are loaded).
 *
 * Keeps track of which multiblocks are formed. Why not keep track of this in
 * the block class itself? Well, 1) it's a cached value and not one that should be
 * persisted, so it makes more sense to have it here. 2) it should be abstracted away
 * from the implementor of Multiblock, and if it was stored on the block, each
 * implementor would have to add a formed field to their class.
 *
 * Keeping track of whether a multiblock is formed is *rather* more complicated than
 * you'd think, because Bukkit's events are fired before the state update takes place.
 * This means we cannot simply re-check if the multiblock is formed whenever a component
 * is modified, because that modification has not been reflected in the world yet. This
 * is the reason why we keep track of 'dirty' multiblocks whose components have been
 * modified, and re-check all the dirty multiblocks every so often. This is also more
 * efficient because it batches checks.
