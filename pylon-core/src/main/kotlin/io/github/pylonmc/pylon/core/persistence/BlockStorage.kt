/**
 * Welcome to the circus!
 *
 * BlockStorage maintains persistent storage for blocks. Why is this necessary? Due to limitations of
 * Paper/Minecraft, we cannot associate arbitrary data with blocks like we can with entities.
 *
 * We use MapDB for this, the simplest database I could find for this task (and extremely performant).
 *
 * This works based on chunks rather than individual blocks. When a chunk is loaded, the
 * associated data for all the Pylon blocks in that chunk is loaded. And conversely, when a chunk is
 * unloaded, all the data for that chunk is saved. Additionally, there are autosaves so chunks that
 * are not ever unloaded are still saved occasionally.
 *
 * We use PylonPersistentDataContainer as the data format. When saving, we can simply ask the block
 * to write its state to the container, then we serialize that container and write it to the database.
 * And when loading, we deserialize the container, figure out which block type it is, and then create
 * a new block of that type, using the container to restore the state it had when it was saved.
 *
 * Saving and loading is done using a queue system. Every time we need to save/load, the chunk in
 * question is added to the queue. A worker thread that runs every tick then picks up tasks from the
 * queues and saves/loads the chunk. This is mainly to avoid doing potentially expensive database
 * reads/writes on the main thread.
 *
 * Read AND write access to the loaded block data must be synchronized, as there are multiple fields
 * for loaded blocks. If access is not synchronized, situations may occur where these fields are
 * briefly out of sync. For example, if we unload a chunk, there will be a short delay between
 * deleting the chunk from `blocksByChunk`, and deleting all of its blocks from `blocks`.
