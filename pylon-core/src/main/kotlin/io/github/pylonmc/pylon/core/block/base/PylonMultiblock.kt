/**
 * Represents a structure composed of multiple blocks.
 *
 * This is an extremely flexible class designed to account for almost any multiblock you could want
 * to create. However, most multiblocks can probably use [PylonSimpleMultiblock].
 *
 * Multiblocks are more difficult than normal Pylon blocks for the simple reason that a multiblock
 * may contain some blocks that have not been loaded because they are in a different chunk.
 *
 * Ticking multiblocks should only tick when `isFormedAndFullyLoaded()` returns true, to avoid
 * ticking a multiblock that is either not formed, or not fully loaded (i.e., not all of its components
 * are loaded).
